1) project is an active background wallpapaer run through Lively. The program was created using HTML, CSS, and 
   JS. Once finding the correctly active background engine and learning to implement my own program, my goal was 
   to learn as much as I can about CSS. 

2) The large majority of the graphics were created using CSS. A JS library, 'vanilla-tilt.js', was added and 
   editted a bit for effect (this will make more sense in the code comments of the HTML file). A link to the 
   download is included, but is also in the main file folder.

3) The project can be found on my webpage, but if you wish to run Lively on your own device a link for the download 
   is included. Once downloaded, save the main () folder and drag the 'glowingCircleBackground" HTML file into
   Lively.
