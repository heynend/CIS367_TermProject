1) My term project is an active background wallpapaer run through Lively. The program was 
created using HTML, CSS, and JS. Once finding the correctly active background engine and
learning to implement my own program, my goal was to learn as much as I can about CSS. 

2) The large majority of the graphics were created using CSS. A JS library, 
'vanilla-tilt.js' (https://micku7zu.github.io/vanilla-tilt.js/), was added and editted a 
bit for effect.

3) The project can be found on my webpage, but if you wish to use the program with Lively
a link for the download is included:
